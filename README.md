## Algorithms

This is where I explore computer science through javascript.  Javascript is a great place to work on algorithms for two reasons.

-  There is a lot of really slow javascript code.  This includes native methods.
-  You can use what you learned in production unlike python where it is hard to beat the compiled code like tim sort from the sorted method.

When I started this I had yet to use modules so I am very interested if Browserify code operates at the same speed as an IIFE like a library such as lodash uses. 

All code going forward with be written in es2015 compiled with babel unless I change my mind.  Also I think Rollup will be a better option than Browserify in the future, I am just not positive how to use it yet.
